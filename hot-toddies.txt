A hot toddy, also hot totty and hot tottie as well as hot whiskey in Ireland, is typically a mixed drink made of liquor and water with sugar and spices and served hot.[1] Hot toddy recipes vary and are traditionally drunk before going to bed, or in wet or cold weather. Some believe the drink relieves the symptoms of the cold and flu â€” in How to Drink, Victoria Moore describes the drink as "the vitamin C for health, the honey to soothe, the alcohol to numb."[2]
